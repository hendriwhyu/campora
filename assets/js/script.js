/*
 * DEPRECATED: This file has been refactored into modular components
 * 
 * The functionality previously contained in this file has been split into
 * separate modules for better organization and maintainability:
 * 
 * - utils.js: Common utility functions
 * - hamburger-menu.js: Hamburger menu functionality
 * - image-modal.js: Image modal functionality
 * - destination-filter.js: Destination filtering functionality
 * - testimonial-carousel.js: Testimonial carousel functionality
 * - auth-manager.js: Authentication and user management
 * - main.js: Main application initialization and global event handlers
 * 
 * To use the new modular structure, include these files in your HTML:
 * 
 * <script src="assets/js/utils.js"></script>
 * <script src="assets/js/hamburger-menu.js"></script>
 * <script src="assets/js/image-modal.js"></script>
 * <script src="assets/js/destination-filter.js"></script>
 * <script src="assets/js/testimonial-carousel.js"></script>
 * <script src="assets/js/auth-manager.js"></script>
 * <script src="assets/js/main.js"></script>
 * 
 * Make sure to include them in the correct order, with utils.js first
 * and main.js last.
